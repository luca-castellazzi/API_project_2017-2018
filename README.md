# API Project, A.Y. 2017-2018

## Overview
This is the project of the "Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica" course @ Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2017-2018.

The goal of the project is the implementation of a Non-Deterministic Turing Machine Simulator using the C programming language.

Project specifications can be found [here]().\
Note that the linked specifications are the translated version of the [original italian file]().

This project obtained a mark of 30/30 Cum Laude.\
The final mark was based on the efficiency of the algorithm w.r.t. both temporal and memory constraints.

## How to run the code
1. Clone this repository
2. Open a terminal window and go in the repository folder
3. Type ```./NDTMSimulator < input_samples/INPUT_FILE_NAME``` (where ```INPUT_FILE_NAME``` should be replaced with one among ```dontGetLost.txt```, ```fancyLoops.txt```, ```increasingStuff.txt```, ```mindYourLeft.txt```, ```toCOrNotToC.txt```, ```unionStuck.txt```)

The output can be checked looking at the corresponding file in the ```output_samples``` folder.
